# custom-controller
a controller built from the carcasses of other main stream controllers

# Needs
* 2 analog sticks
* stick buttons "L3/R3"
* dpad
* 4 action buttons
* 2 shoulder buttons
* 2 analog triggers
* start, select, and home buttons

# Wants?
* 6? (more?) action buttons to MAP ALL THE THINGS
* camera stick could be touchpad, don't know how that would affect aiming
* dpad could be touchpad, would give more controll over selections ingame
* action buttons - analog might be neat, but a digital "bottom out" button would be necessary
* shoulder buttons (analog might be neat, but a digital "bottom out" button would be necessary)
* triggers (force feedback would be neat) (digital "bottom out" button not necessary, but would be neat)
* "dualsense" trigger mechanism from ps5 and hall effect mechanish from xbox one, might be neat but kind of complicated
* bottom grip buttons - might be difficult to actuate but would add 2 more configurable buttons
* three-axis accelerometer and gyroscope - neat to know the controller angles

# OG Xbox (discontinued, okay price)
* 6 action buttons?

action buttons (ABXY and white/black)

# Xbox One controller (in-production, expensive)
* overall layout?
* analog triggers?
* vibe motors?
* each trigger features independent rumble motors called "Impulse Triggers"

i like the overall layout of the xbox one controller, some form of analog trigger is necessary<br/>
the vibe motors are a standard affair in basically all controllers now adays<br/>
impulse trigger might be neat, but wouldn't work if going with the ps5 "dualsense" triggers

# Steam controller (discontinued, expensive)
* touchpads?
* bottom grip buttons?
* haptics?

the bottom grip buttons add two more buttons for things, but i don't know how difficult they would be to actuate<br/>
i don't really know how or where i would use the touchpads<br/>
maybe as a right "thumbstick", i guess i don't use the dpad all that much and a touchpad there might work?<br/>
haptics appear to be soldered to the touchpads

# Playstation 2 controller (discontinued, cheapish)
* analog action buttons?

# Playstation 5 controller (in-production, expensive)
* "dualsense" triggers?
* touchpad?
* voice coil actuator haptics?
* battery?

i think the force feedback of the ps5 controller triggers would be neat to have, same with a touchpad<br/>
haptics are different from simple vibe motor, but i don't know in what ways<br/>
a rechargable battery takes up space and in general i wouldn't use, but it might be nice to have one and the ps5 controller has a 1500? mAh battery

# Nintendo Switch controller (in-production, expensive)
* plus/minus?
* short joysticks?
* infrared depth tracking sensor?
* haptic feedback engine known as "HD Rumble"?

the short joysticks of the joycons would take up less space<br/>
plus/minus basically replace start/select but might be neat to have more buttons?<br/>
infrared sensor might be neat, but what the heck would it be used for?<br/>
haptic feedback. how is it different from xbox, ps5, and steam controllers
